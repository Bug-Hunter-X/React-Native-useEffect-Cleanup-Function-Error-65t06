This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error. This can happen if the cleanup function tries to access a component's state or props after the component has unmounted.  The error might not be immediately apparent because it happens after the component has unmounted, but it could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.
